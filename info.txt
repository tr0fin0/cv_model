I’m Guilherme Nunes Trofino, a 22-year-old Brazilian student from the Campinas State University – UNICAMP, pursuing since 2022 a 3-year double degree exchange program at ENSTA Paris. There I’ve been enrolled in their Information and Communication Sciences and Technologies master’s degree with robotics as chosen emphasis. Now I’m half-way through a gap year looking for a 5-month internship available from the 25th of March until the 9th of September.

I wish to work with Data Analysis because I believe that well-informed decisions are key for taking the best possible course of action available. I’ve chosen to pursue a gap year because I wanted to gain professional experience and have opportunities to learn new important analytical skills needed to keep improving my abilities by developing the right tools and extracting the right insights from data.
